# Exploding Cats
Hi! Welcome to CSE 110 Fall 2021 Group 33's team page. Our team name is **Exploding Cats**. On this page are our team brand, values, and member roster. 
## Brand
### Team Name
The idea behind the name Exploding Cats came when we played [Gartic Phone](https://garticphone.com/), a game where you play telephone, but with drawing. 
Although our members are mostly unassuming and fairly quiet, we found that plenty of our drawings were violent and unexpected. 
When coming up with a team name, we tried conjuring up images of this unusual blend of quiet and violent, and hence, Exploding Cats was born!
### Team Logo
### Team Mascot
As featured in our logo, our team mascot is a white cat named Explodey. Though normally timid and friendly, at any moment, Explodey can erupt into action,
pouncing on unsuspecting victims and leaving havoc wherever he goes.
### Team Colors
## Values
As listed on our [group contract](./misc/rules.md), our team believes and exhibits the following values:
- Humility, Respect, and Trust
- Honesty about mistakes or confusion
- Group accountability
- Inclusiveness
- General courtesy

Furthermore, we believe strongly in team communication, regular team meetings, firm yet gentle conflict resolution, and professional coding practices.
